# Floatcam

Floatcam is a simple camera app that you can use alongside any screen recorder. It floats on top of other apps, so you can easily record your screen and your face at the same time. 

It is perfect for recording tutorials, gameplay, or anything else you want to share with the world. You can easily move it around while recording as opposed to doing it in post-production.

## Features

Floatcam features a wide range of settings for 

- Customizing the shape of the floating window
- Changing the size of the floating window
- Adding a filter to the camera preview
- Adding a border to the window 

Floatcam is free and open source software. You can find the source code on [GitHub]

There are too many screen recorders out there so Floatcam doesn't come with one. Instead, you can use any screen recorder you want. I recommend [AZ Screen Recorder] or [DU Recorder].


## Why Floatcam?

There are a lot of screen recorders out there but most of them don't have a built-in camera. Others do but it's either not floating, they can't be moved around, or not customizable. Some even requires payment for such a simple feature. 

I remember using the default screen recorder on Mac (QuickTime). On Quicktime, you can easily record your screen and your face at the same time but the challenge with recording your face is that your camera preview is forever forced to sit in a rectangular box with a fixed minimum size. You also can't change the shape of the window, or add filters or do crazy things like effects. Loom, a popular screen recorder let's you do some of these things but it's not free. With so many screen recorders out there, I thought it would be nice to have a simple camera app that you can use alongside any screen recorder.

I hope you enjoy using Floatcam as much as I enjoyed making it. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter] or [Telegram].

## Roadmap

I have thought about some cool features that I would like to add to Floatcam some of which are:

- Screen annotation (draw on the screen). Sometimes, you want to highlight something on the screen while recording. This feature will let you do that.
- Screen magnifier. Sometimes, you want to zoom in on a part of the screen while recording. This feature will let you do that.
- A quick whiteboard. Sometimes, you want to write something on the screen while recording. This feature will let you do that.
- Protect an area of the screen. Sometimes, you want to hide something on the screen while recording. This feature will let you do that.

While all the above features are great ideas, I don't have the time to work on them right now. I will work on them when I have the time. If you have any other ideas, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter] or [Telegram]. Also, there are already tools out there that do some of these things. I will try to integrate them into Floatcam when I have the time.
